# QZoneAutoSend

First install selenium and PhantomJS on your Pi.

Then change QQ and Passwd to yours, input the desired text and run #sudo python test.py and it will work.

At least on my Pi it works.

/*
This Repo is created by a noob.
I want to make my Raspberry automatically post the weather info to my QZone, so I created this.
Might take my lifetime to complete this hhh.

Based on Selenium and PhantomJS, coded in Python.
